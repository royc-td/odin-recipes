  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is a traditional Filipino recipe for lumpia, or fried spring rolls. They're made with lumpia wrappers
  and filled with a mixture of ground pork and vegetables.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
  <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
  <li>1/2 cup minced carrots</li>
  <li>1/2 cup chopped green onions</li>
  <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced green cabbage</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
  <li>30 lumpia wrappers</li>
  <li>2 cups vegetable oil</li>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <h4>Step 1</h4>
  <p>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or skillet over high heat. Add pork; cook and stir until crumbly and no longer pink - 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pork from the pan and set aside. Drain grease from the pan leaving a thin coating.</p>
  <h4>Step 2</h4>
  <p>Add onion and garlic to the pan; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes</p>
  <h4>Step 3</h4>
  <p>Stir in cooked pork, carrots, green onions and cabbage</p>
  <h4>Step 4</h4>
  <p>To assemble lumpa: Place 3 heaping tablespoons of filling diagonally near one corner of a lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1 1/2 inch space at both ends</p>
  <h4>Step 5</h4>
  <p>Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both ends and roll neatly and tightly to close.</p>
  <h4>Step 6</h4>
  <p>Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal edge. Transfer to a plate and cover with plastic wrap to retain moisture. Repeat this step to assemble remaining lumpia</p>
  <h4>Step 7</h4>
  <p>Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes.</p>
  <h4>Step 8</h4>
  <p>Slide 3 to 4 lumpia into the hot oil, making sure the seams are facing down. Fry and turn occasionally until all sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat to fry remaining lumpia</p>
  <h4>Step 9</h4>
  <p>Serve immediately and enjoy!</p>
