  <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
  <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
  <li>3 medium potatoes, chopped</li>
  <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
  <li>3 1/2 cups water, or as needed</li>
  <li>1 container curry sauce mix (such as S&B Golden Curry)</body>li>
  <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon apricot jam</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
  <h3>Chicken Katsu:</h3>
  <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
  <li>kosher salt and ground </li>
  <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 large egg, beaten, or as needed</li>
  <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
  <li>1/2 cup peanut oil for frying</li>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <h4>Step 1</h4>
  <p>Make the curry sauce: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook onions in hot oil until soft and starting to caramelize, about 8 minutes. Add potatoes and carrots. Pour in water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until potatoes are soft - about 45 minutes</p>
  <h4>Step 2</h4>
  <p>Remove from heat and stir in curry sauce mix until dissolved. Add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, jam, and soy sauce.
  Simmer until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
  <h4>Step 3</h4>
  <p>Meanwhile, make the chicken katsu: Flatten chicken breasts with a kitchen mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Season with
  salt and pepper.</p>
  <h4>Step 4</h4>
  <p>Place flour onto a large plate, add beaten egg to a small plate, and place bread crumbs onto a second large plate.</p>
  <h4>Step 5</h4>
  <p>Press chicken into flour to coat, dip in beaten egg, and press in bread crumbs to coat generously.</p>
  <h4>Step 6</h4>
  <p>Heat oil in a large saucepan to 180 degrees C. Carefully lower breaded cutlets into hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into a cutlet should read 75 degrees C</p>
  <h4>Step 7</h4>
  <p>While chicken is cooking, stir curry powder into sauce until incorporated</p>
  <h4>Step 8</h4>
  <p>Slice chicken into strips and spoon curry sauce over the top to serve.</p>
